some notes when u set it up its a bit slow cuz its offline and keeps ur data secure
when u upload the pdf just click it once it takes a second don't double click the file will crash
ðŸ’” Girlfriend Emotionâ€‘Tracker
Ever wish you could figure out why sheâ€™s mad this time? This tool helps you analyze your chat history to detect emotional patterns, explain her feelings, and gradually adapt to your unique relationship dynamic.

ðŸ“¦ Setup Instructions
Note: This repo does not include model weights due to GitHub file size limits.

To run the app locally:

1. Clone the repo
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/girlfriend-emotion-tracker.git
cd girlfriend-emotion-tracker
2. Create a virtual environment
bash
Copy code
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or `.venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Download model files manually
Sentence embedding model (384-dim)
Download all-MiniLM-L6-v2 from HuggingFace:
https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2
Place it in: models/embedding/

Quantized Mistral 7B model
Download mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q4_K_M.gguf from TheBloke's HuggingFace repo:
https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF
Place it in: models/llm/

4. Run the app
bash
Copy code
streamlit run main.py
ðŸ§  How It Works
On the surface, itâ€™s a button that tells you why sheâ€™s upset. But under the hood:

Message Embeddings
Every message gets turned into a 384â€‘dimensional vector â€” think GPS coordinates in "meaningâ€‘land" â€” using a MiniLM encoder.

Fast Semantic Search
A FAISS HNSW index lets us retrieve the top 10 closest messages to any emotion-based query in milliseconds.

Emotion Detection
We use a GoEmotions classifier to assign 27 possible emotional labels to every message in your history.

LLM Explanation
These messages and their emotional tags are passed to a quantized 7â€‘billionâ€‘parameter Mistral model â€” running entirely locally, so there are no cloud fees or data leaks.


ðŸ™‹ Why?
Because relationships are hard, and we might as well use AI to give us a fighting chance.
Its a bit slow cuz the models are big and offline
